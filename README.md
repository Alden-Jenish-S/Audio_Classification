## Overview
   This deep learning model is designed to count the number of Capuchinbird calls within a given audio clip. Capuchinbirds are known for their distinctive calls, 
  and this model utilizes deep learning techniques to identify and quantify those calls in audio recordings.

## Task
   This task was taken from Z by HP Unlocked Challenge 3 Audio Recognition. 
 The challenge can be accessed from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kenjee/z-by-hp-unlocked-challenge-3-signal-processing)

 ## Model Architecture
   The model architecture is built using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 
  to capture both spatial and temporal features in the spectogram of audio data. The model has been trained on a labeled dataset containing audio clips with annotated Capuchinbird call counts.
